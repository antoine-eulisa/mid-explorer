TODO

- when a group is returned in the query graph find a way to represent which of the following is returned (could be a combination):
  - system <- meaning the group is colored, otherwise gray
  - reference <- add the number
  - id data <- the filled circle
  - business data <- add another circle around it
- allow differenciating for Special systems and red links towards them
